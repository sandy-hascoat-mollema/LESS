# ion platform theming LESS

LESS code to be used by the creative services team to generate CSS for customer themes and micro-themes. The theme is applied by the ion publisher to control the look and feel of their pages. Micro-themes then can be applied to individual elements on the page to control the look and feel of elements. Such as: buttons, links, backgrounds, components, etcâ€¦ 

Originally coded by an engineer team member, then completely overhauled by myself and another member of the creative services team (pair coded).
