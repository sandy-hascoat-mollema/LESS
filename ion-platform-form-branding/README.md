# ion platform form branding

LESS code to be used by the creative services team to generate CSS for customer micro-themes. These form micro-themes can be applied to dynamic forms within the ion platform and will control the look and feel of text, drop-down, slider, choice groups, etc… 

I pair coded this with another team member from ion’s engineer team.
